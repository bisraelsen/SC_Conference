\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
    Algorithmic assurances assist human users in trusting advanced autonomous systems appropriately. This work explores one approach to creating assurances in which systems self-assess their decision-making capabilities, resulting in a `self-confidence' measure. 
    We present a framework for self-confidence assessment and reporting using meta-analysis factors, and then develop a new factor pertaining to `solver quality' in the context of solving Markov decision processes (MDPs), which are widely used in autonomous systems. A novel method for computing solver quality self-confidence is derived, drawing inspiration from empirical hardness models. Numerical examples show our approach has desirable properties for enabling an MDP-based agent to self-assess its for performing a given task under different conditions. Experimental results for a simulated autonomous vehicle navigation task delegation problem %investigating the effects of self-confidence reporting on user tasking of a simulated autonomous vehicle are presented. The results 
    show significantly improved delegated task performance outcomes in conditions where self-confidence reports is provided to users. %vs. conditions where no reports are provided. %%,and open promising avenues for future work. %Discussion of results, and avenues for future investigation are included.
