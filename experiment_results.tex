\section{Experiment Results} \label{sec:exp_results}
Here, we present some preliminary findings. In order to explore the actual effects of \famsec on user behavior we designed a Mechanical Turk experiment where human users acted as dispatch supervisors of an autonomous vehicle (see Fig.~\ref{fig:experiment}). 

The vehicle had to complete a delivery within a given time limit as well as avoid another vehicle that could capture it. The users were trained to understand how the task would work.
